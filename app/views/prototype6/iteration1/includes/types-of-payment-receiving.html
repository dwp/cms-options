<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Receiving child maintenance</h1>
<p class="govuk-body">If you choose to use the Child Maintenance Service there is a £20 application fee. You will not have to pay this fee if you are under 19 years old or have experienced domestic abuse.</p>
<p>There are 2 ways you can get payments.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Direct Pay</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">The other parent will pay child maintenance directly to your bank account.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">You do not need to have any contact with the other parent and there are no additional fees.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Collect and Pay</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">The Child Maintenance Service will collect maintenance from the other parent and pass it to you.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">You can only start with Collect and Pay if the other parent:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    refuses to respond to us
  </li>
  <li>
    has missed previous payments (and there is evidence of this)
  </li>
  <li>
    agrees to use Collect and Pay
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">You can change to Collect and Pay later if Direct Pay does not work.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">There are extra fees for this service, which are:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    20% will be added to the other parent's payment
  </li>
  <li>
    4% will be taken off the payment you receive
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">For example, if the payment amount was £100, you would get £96 and the other parent would pay £120.</p>
