<h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Paying child maintenance</h1>
<p class="govuk-body">If you choose to use the Child Maintenance Service there is a £20 application fee. You will not have to pay this fee if you are under 19 years old or have experienced domestic abuse.</p>
<p class="govuk-body"">There are 2 ways you can make payments.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Direct Pay</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">You’ll pay maintenance directly into the other parent’s bank account.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">You do not need to have any contact with the other parent and there are no additional fees.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Collect and Pay</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">The Child Maintenance Service will collect maintenance from you and pass it to the other parent.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">You can only start with Collect and Pay if the other parent agrees to it.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Collect and Pay can be enforced if you stop responding to us or stop making payments.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">There are extra fees for this service, which are:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    20% (added to your payment)
  </li>
  <li>
    4% (taken off the payment the other parent receives)
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">For example, if the payment amount was £100, you would pay £120 and the other parent would get £96.</p>
