<p class="govuk-body">The Child Maintenance Service may be able to arrange child maintenance for you. Using the Child Maintenance Service is less flexible than making your own arrangement because the calculation is a fixed amount based on the paying parent’s earnings.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Using the Child Maintenance Service might be a good option if you do not have contact with the other parent, you do not think they will stick to an agreement or if you do not feel safe dealing with them.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">The Child Maintenance Service will:</p>
