<p class="govuk-body">If you choose to use the Child Maintenance Service there is a £20 application fee. You will not have to pay this fee if you are under 19 years old or have experienced domestic abuse.</p>
<p class="govuk-body"">There are 2 ways you can make payments.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Direct Pay</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">You’ll pay child maintenance directly into the other parent’s bank account.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">You do not need to have any contact with the other parent and there are no additional fees.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Collect and Pay</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">The Child Maintenance Service will collect maintenance from you and pass it to the other parent.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">You can only start with Collect and Pay if the other parent agrees to it.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Collect and Pay can be enforced if you stop responding to us or stop making payments.</p>
